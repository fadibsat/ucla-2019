# Rock-Paper-Scissors game

import random

# Here is the code for a rock-paper-scissors game against the computer:
#    The game should ask for the player to type r for rock, p for paper, s for scissors, or q to quit
#    Then it should choose a random move for the computer
#    Print what the computer did, and who won
#    Print the current score
#    Repeat until the player quits

#    Each function below has one or more bugs, fix them so the game works!
#    The bugs may be syntax errors, one missing line of code, or code that does not do what we want.
#    You only need to make small changes, don't overthink it!
